# Program Cycle
## The lifecycle of a program. (as I have noticed)

### 1st Stage: Early Development
First release. Usually there are many updates here
### 2nd Stage: Development
This is when it starts getting updated less. It's when it's a pretty stable program and the developer settles down.
### 3rd Stage: Late Development
This is when it nears rare updates. Features start to get scarce.
### 4th Stage: Rare Development
This is when it is usually rarely updated. The developer has a limited amount of time to add what they want to. People may start to get worried about the fifth stage starting:
### 5th Stage: Abandoned
Stops getting updated at all. Sometimes new devs come along and the whole cycle repeats. Sometimes not.
### 6th Stage: Obsoletion
I hope it never happens with my programs: No one uses the program because it is no longer updated. It depends when it starts, sometimes (hopefully) NEVER.
